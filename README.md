Task
=====

Please take the attached code and do the following:
1. add some simple validation (e.g. longer than 5 characters) to the todo-task input field, using react-redux-form. (https://davidkpiano.gitbooks.io/react-redux-form/content/validation.html)
2. add the ability to prioritize tasks, so that the more important tasks will appear above the less important tasks. (Add a dropdown to select from "Low", "Medium", "High" priorities)
Please save all UI states in redux store, rather than in React states. 
Please complete it within 2 days and send it as a zip file. Please do not post the solution on github or anywhere public.
